## Primitive Data Types

- Types of data used in JavaScript that serve as the basic building blocks of every program.
- String, number, boolean, null\*, undefined\*

  *\*These data types are weird.*
  
  *\***Null** means a value does not exist*  
  *\***Undefined** means something (a variable) has not been defined*

Any **expression** in Javascript will return a value (`2 + 2` returns `4`), and that value will have a type. A value's **type** tells us what kind of 'thing' it is.

`2 + "2"` returns `"22"` -- it is concatenating the two values and returns a string

`typeof(10 > 2)` returns `boolean`  
`typeof(a)` returns `undefined` since value 'a' has not been defined
