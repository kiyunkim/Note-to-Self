  - Process: step-by-step guidance, repeatable from project to project
  - Framework: definition of key tasks and routine, is non-prescriptive
- Relies on a cycle of sprints
- Defines specific roles for a team (scrum master, product owner, developers)
- Defines specific meetings for a sprint 
  - Each role is represented in all meetings
  - Enhances communication within team

### Value/Effort Matrix
  
  - Quickly rank features by their **value** relative to its **effort** or difficulty.
  - 4 Quadrant map: x-axis as difficulty, y-axis as value
  - Used for 'nice to have' features, not critical or need-have features
