# Agile

- a methodology/philosophy; [Kanban](#kanban) and [Scrum](#scrum) are frameworks for the Agile environment
- [JIRA](#jira) is an issue tracker commonly used by Agile teams
- Wikipedia:
  - Agile software development describes a set of values and principle for software development in which the requirements and solutions change and evolve through the collaborative effort of cross-functional teams. 
  - It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, continuous movement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

  
### Value/Effort Matrix
  
  - Quickly rank features by their **value** relative to its **effort** or difficulty.
  - 4 Quadrant map: x-axis as difficulty, y-axis as value
  - Used for 'nice to have' features, not critical or need-have features
  
## Kanban

- Follows a continuous flow
- Minimizes upfront planning
- Always work on the most important task first

## Scrum

- A framework, not a process
  - Process: step-by-step guidance, repeatable from project to project
  - Framework: definition of key tasks and routine, is non-prescriptive
- Relies on a cycle of sprints
- Defines specific roles for a team (scrum master, product owner, developers)
- Defines specific meetings for a sprint 
  - Each role is represented in all meetings
  - Enhances communication within team

## JIRA
- Created by Atlassian
- First and foremost issue tracking -- but has evolved into a tool for planning and organizing projects used by Agile teams

### Issues
- **Issues** can be used to describe a new feature, bug, task, or improvement
- Anatomy of an issue
  - Base information and fields (key, summary, timestamps, assignees)
  - Resolution (fixed, won't fix, duplicate) and Status (open, closed)
  - Custom fields

### JIRA Concepts
- Issue can belong to several **components**
  - Components are part of a project (e.g. user interface, database, business component)
- All issues must be assigned to a project
  - In JIRA a project will have its own home page or dashboard

### Vocab

- **Epic**: High level category; has no starting or end date. Specific stories and tasks will be assigned under it. (e.g. Performance improvement is an epic)
- **Story**: Used for larger amounts of work
- **Task**: Simpler and smaller
  - **Sub-task**
- **Bug**
