## WCAG Standard Guidlines 2.0
### [POUR](https://webaim.org/articles/pour/)
Basis of most web accessibility law, based on four principles that spells out POUR

- **Perceiveable:** Available to the senses (vision and hearing primarily) through assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers, screen enlargers, etc.)
- **Operable:** Users can interact with all controls using either the mouse, keyboard, or an assistive device.
- **Understandable:** Content is clear and limits confusion and ambiguity.
- **Robust:** A wide range of technologies (including old & new) can access the content.

## Principles of Accessible Design
- Provide appropriate alternative text
- Provide appropriate document structure
- Provider headers for data tables
- Ensure users can complete and submit forms
- Ensure links make sense out of context (avoid "click here")
- Caption and/or provide transcripts for media
- Allow users to skip repetitive elements on the page
- **Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning**
- Make sure content is clearly written and easy to read
- Make JavaScript accessible
