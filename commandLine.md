#### Vocabulary
- **Shell**
  - In computing, a **shell** is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a **command-line interface** (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.
