Simple command
```command
$ pwd
/Users/kiyun
$
```

- Do not type in the `$` (Unix) or `>` (Windows). That's just showing you my **session** so you can see what I got.
- You can then see what I have for output followed by another `$` or `>` **prompt**. That content is the output and you should see the same output.

#### Vocabulary
- **Shell**
  - In computing, a **shell** is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a **command-line interface** (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.
- **Folder and Directory** are the same thing
- **Session**
- **Prompt**
