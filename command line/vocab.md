## Vocabulary
- **Shell**
  - In computing, a **shell** is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a **command-line interface** (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.
- **Folder = Directory**
- **Session**
  - Do not type in the `$` (Unix) or `>` (Windows). That's just showing you my **session** so you can see what I got.
- **Prompt**
  - You can then see what I have for output followed by another `$` or `>` **prompt**. That content is the output and you should see the same output.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**  
  - Means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** 
  - Program interface that takes advantage of the computer's graphics capabilities to make the program easier to use. Well-designed graphical user interfaces can free the user from learning complex command languages.  [Webopedia](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/G/Graphical_User_Interface_GUI.html)
